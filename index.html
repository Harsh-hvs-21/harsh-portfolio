    <h2>Projects and Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Vendor Penalty Calculation Automation | Synergy Award</h3></li>
        <p>Received Automation Synergy Award for developing and leading a BOT using RPA and VBA macro integration toautomate vendor penalty calculations. Collaborated with Vendor Management team to overcome challenges oftime-consuming manual calculations with unclean data, achieving 100% data accuracy and reducing reportgeneration time from 1 month to 1hr. Resulted in approximately $2M in accurately charged penalties to vendors.</p>
        
        <li><h3>MSP DNA License Governance BOT</h3></li>
        <p>Implemented a governance BOT to identify incorrect MSP DNA License orders that were not eligible for the 100%discount. The BOT automatically sends an email to the order requestor, providing necessary details and requestingthem to cancel the order and place a new one with the vendor to avail the discount. This automation resulted insaving approximately $200k in Opex costs and significantly improved the accuracy of order bookings</p>
        
        <li><h3>Vendor RMA Report Automation and Dashboard | Change Maker Award</h3></li>
        <p>Implemented an automated weekly report to identify outstanding RMA cases that needed to be retrieved andreturned to the warehouse. Previously, stakeholders spent approximately 1 hour preparing this report. However, withthis automation, it now takes only 15 minutes, resulting in a time-saving of 45 minutes. The accompanyingdashboard enables swift identification of necessary actions, leading to a reduction of outstanding open RMA casesfrom $9M to $3M within a 7-month period.</p>
    
        <li><h3>Purchase Order Receipting BOT | Flare Award</h3></li>
        <p>Developed an unattended Python BOT that identifies delivered order receipts in the system, addressing thechallenge faced by the operation team in receipting purchase orders. This automation enables the finance team torelease payments to vendors promptly, improving operational efficiency and ensuring compliance with processrequirements. The BOT saves time and enhances collaboration between the operation and finance teams.</p>
